# IBM-PHASE-5
# Fake News Detection using NLP

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains a Fake News Detection project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and categorize news articles as either real or fake. In a world inundated with information, the ability to discern trustworthy news sources from misleading or fabricated ones is crucial. This project aims to provide a tool for automatically detecting fake news articles, thereby promoting informed decision-making and responsible news consumption.

## Motivation

The rapid spread of fake news can have significant consequences, such as misinforming the public, influencing public opinion, and even inciting panic or violence. This project is motivated by the need to develop a reliable automated system for detecting fake news, which can serve as a valuable tool for media outlets, fact-checking organizations, and individuals.

## Project Overview

This project is centered around the use of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to build a fake news detection model. The primary components of the project include:

- **Data Collection**: Acquiring a dataset of labeled news articles, consisting of both real and fake news, to train and evaluate the model.

- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis. This includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and text vectorization.

- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features from the text data that can be used to distinguish between real and fake news.

- **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models, such as natural language processing models, deep learning models, or a combination of both, to classify news articles as real or fake.

- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance through various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Deployment**: Optionally, deploying the trained model as an API or web application for real-time fake news detection.
